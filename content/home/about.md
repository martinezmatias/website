# Biography

I am assistant professor in the University of Valenciennes (France), and member of the LAMIH laboratory (UMR CNRS 8201). Previously, I was a researcher in the University of Lille 1 and INRIA Lille, and post-doc in the University of Lugano (Switzerland). I got my PhD degree in October 2014 from University of Lille and previously a Computer Science degree from UNICEN (Universidad Nacional del Centro de la Provincia de Buenos Aires, Argentina).  Moreover, I  had teaching duties at the engineering school Telecom Lille. I also have worked in the private sector as software developer (Java, Web, SOA, Mobile).  Currently I develop and maintain Astor, an automated program repair tool.
