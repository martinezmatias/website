# About me

I am researcher at the [Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya-BarcelonaTech (UPC)](https://www.upc.edu/) (Spain), and a member of the [inSSIDE](https://insside.upc.edu/en) research group.
<!---I am Associate Professor at the [Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France (France)](http://www.uphf.fr/), and member of the [LAMIH](http://www.univ-valenciennes.fr/LAMIH/en/) laboratory (UMR CNRS 8201). -> 
<!---Previously, I was a researcher in the University of Lille 1 and INRIA Lille, and post-doc in the University of Lugano (Switzerland). -->
I got my PhD degree in October 2014 from [University of Lille (France)](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/) and a Computer Science degree from [UNICEN (Argentina)] (http://www.exa.unicen.edu.ar/).  Moreover, I  had teaching duties at the engineering school [Telecom Lille](http://www.telecom-lille.fr/). 
Previously, I worked as Associate Professor at the [Université Polytechnique Hauts-de-France (France)](http://www.uphf.fr/) and in the private sector as software developer (Java, Web, SOA, Mobile).  
I have developed and maintained several software tools including [Astor](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/astor), an automated program repair framework, and [Coming](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/coming), a tool for mining commits  from Git repositories.

**News**: I appear in the second place on the ranking of **Most Impactful Early-stage Software Engineering Researchers** during the period 2013-2020,  elaborated by the E. Wong et colleagues at [A bibliometric assessment of software engineering themes, scholars and institutions (2013–2020)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0164121221001266), and in the nineteenth place on the ranking of **Most Active Early-stage Software Engineering Researchers in Top-Quality journals**.
