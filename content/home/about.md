# About me

I am Associate Professor at the [Universit√© Polytechnique Hauts-de-France (France)](http://www.uphf.fr/), and member of the [LAMIH](http://www.univ-valenciennes.fr/LAMIH/en/) laboratory (UMR CNRS 8201). 
<!---Previously, I was a researcher in the University of Lille 1 and INRIA Lille, and post-doc in the University of Lugano (Switzerland). -->
I got my PhD degree in October 2014 from [University of Lille (France)](http://www.univ-lille1.fr/) and a Computer Science degree from [UNICEN (Argentina)] (http://www.exa.unicen.edu.ar/).  Moreover, I  had teaching duties at the engineering school [Telecom Lille](http://www.telecom-lille.fr/). 
I have worked in the private sector as software developer (Java, Web, SOA, Mobile).  
Currently I develop and maintain [Astor](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/astor), an automated program repair framework, and [Coming](https://github.com/SpoonLabs/coming), a tool for mining commits  from Git repositories.
